# 🐍 Programming with Python

## **Intro to Programming with Python**

### **1. Software**

Software is a set of instructions to the hardware.

---

### **2. Programming**

Programming means writing the instructions to create a software.

---

### **3. Code**

The instructions that we write to create software is called Code.

---

### **4. Syntax**

Similar to Grammar rules in English, Hindi, each programming language has a unique set of rules. These rules are called the Syntax of a Programming Language.

---

## **Why Python**

Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. With Python, it is possible to create programs with minimal amount of code.

### **Comparison Example:**

**Java:**

```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

**Python:**

```python
print("Hello World")
```

## **Applications of Python**

Python is a versatile language which has applications in almost every field:

- Artificial intelligence (AI)
- Machine Learning (ML)
- Big Data
- Smart Devices / Internet of Things (IoT)
- Cyber Security
- Game Development
- Backend Development, etc.

---

## **Career Opportunities**

Python developers have plenty of opportunities across the world:

- DevOps Engineer
- Software Developer
- Data Analyst
- Data Scientist

## **Hello World Program in Python**

Here is a simple Python code that you can use to display the message "Hello World".

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

**Output:**

```
Hello World!
```

---

## **Possible Mistakes**

Possible mistakes you may make while writing Python code to display the message "Hello World":

### **Spelling Mistake in print**

```python
prnt("Hello World!")
```

### **Uppercase 'P' in Print**

```python
Print("Hello World!")
```

### **Missing quotes**

```python
print(Hello World!)
```

### **Missing parentheses**

```python
print("Hello World!"
```

## **Printing Without Quotes**

If we want to print the numerical result of **2 + 5**, we do not add quotes.

```python
print(2 + 5)
```

**Output:**

```
7
```

If we want to print the exact message **"2 + 5"**, then we add the quotes.

```python
print("2 + 5")
```

**Output:**

```
2 + 5
```

---

## **Calculations with Python**

### **Addition**

Addition is denoted by **+** sign.
It gives the sum of two numbers.

```python
print(2 + 5)
print(1 + 1.5)
```

**Output:**

```
7
2.5
```

---

### **Subtraction**

Subtraction is denoted by **-** sign.
It gives the difference between two numbers.

```python
print(5 - 2)
```

**Output:**

```
3
```

---

### **Multiplication**

Multiplication is denoted by **\*** sign.

```python
print(2 * 5)
print(5 * 0.5)
```

**Output:**

```
10
2.5
```

---

### **Division**

Division is denoted by **/** sign.

```python
print(5 / 2)
print(4 / 2)
```

**Output:**

```
2.5
2.0
```
