# 🧠 Variables and Data Types

## **Variables**

Variables are like containers for storing values.
Values in the variables can be changed.

---

## **Values**

Consider that variables are like containers for storing information.
In context of programming, this information is often referred to as **value**.

---

## **Data Type**

In programming languages, every value or data has an associated type to it known as **data type**.

### Commonly used data types:

- String
- Integer
- Float
- Boolean

This data type determines how the value or data can be used in the program.
For example: mathematical operations can be done on **Integer** and **Float** types of data.

## **String**

A String is a stream of characters enclosed within quotes.

### Stream of Characters include:

- Capital Letters (A–Z)
- Small Letters (a–z)
- Digits (0–9)
- Special Characters (~ ! @ # $ % ^ . ?,)
- Space

### Examples:

"Hello World!"
"[some@example.com](mailto:some@example.com)"
"1234"

### Note:

The stream of characters enclosed within quotes (both single and double quotes) are considered strings.

```python
'hello'
"hello"
```

---

## **Integer**

All whole numbers (positive, negative and zero) without any fractional part come under Integers.

### Examples:

..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...

---

## **Float**

Any number with a decimal point.

### Examples:

24.3, 345.210, -321.86

---

## **Boolean**

In a general sense, anything that can take one of two possible values is considered a Boolean.

### Examples include values like:

- True or False
- Yes or No
- 0 or 1
- On or Off

As per Python Syntax:

- **True** and **False** are Boolean values.
- Both start with a capital letter.

---

## **Assigning Value to a Variable**

Syntax for assigning an integer value 10 to a variable `age`:

```python
age = 10
```

The **=** sign is called the **Assignment Operator** because it is used to assign values to variables.
