# **Simple Rectangle — Solved**

### **Question:**

Write a program that prints a simple rectangle using stars (\*).

---

## **Input**

(No input for this problem.)

## **Output**

Three lines, each containing two stars separated by a space:

```
* *
* *
* *
```

---

## **Explanation**

We need to print:

- Two stars on the first line
- Two stars on the second line
- Two stars on the third line

The pattern is fixed, so we simply print the same line three times.

# **Approach**

### **Step 1:** No input needed

The rectangle to print is fixed.

### **Step 2:** Prepare the pattern

Each line should contain `* *`.

### **Step 3:** Print the pattern three times

Use `print()` three times.

# **Step-by-Step Explanation**

### **Step 1: No input**

Nothing to read.

### **Step 2: Define the line**

```python
line = "* *"
```

### **Step 3: Print it three times**

```python
print(line)
print(line)
print(line)
```
