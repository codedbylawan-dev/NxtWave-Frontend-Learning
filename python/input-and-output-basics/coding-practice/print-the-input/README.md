## 🧠 Approach

### **Step 1: Read the Input**

We will use Python’s `input()` function to read a line of input from the user.
We will store it in a variable called `a`.

```python
a = input()
```

---

### **Step 2: Print the Input**

Now that we have the value stored in `a`, we simply print it using `print()`.

```python
print(a)
```

---

## ✅ Solution

Here is the complete solution for the coding question:

```python
# This program reads a single line of input and prints it
a = input()
print(a)
```

This program will read anything the user enters — a word, a number, or even a full sentence — and print it exactly as it is.
