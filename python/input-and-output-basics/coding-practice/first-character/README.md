# 📝 **Step-by-Step Explanation**

## **Step 1: Read the word**

Read the input word from the user using the `input()` function and store it in a variable called `word`.

```python
word = input()
```

## **Step 2: Extract the first character**

In Python, we can access characters in a string by their index. The first character is at index `0`. Store it in a variable called `first_character`.

```python
first_character = word[0]
```

---

## **Step 3: Print the first character**

Use the `print()` function to display the first character.

```python
print(first_character)
```

---

# ✅ **Final Solution**

```python
word = input()
first_character = word[0]
print(first_character)
```

This program will produce:

```
P
