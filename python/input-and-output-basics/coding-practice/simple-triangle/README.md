# 📝 **Step-by-Step Explanation**

## **Step 1: Understand the problem**

We need to print a triangle shape using stars (`*`).  
The shape looks like:

```
*
**
```

That means:

- Line 1 → 1 star
- Line 2 → 2 stars

So we print two lines using the `print()` function.

---

## **Step 2: Print the first line**

To print a single star, we simply write:

```python
print("*")
```

---

## **Step 3: Print the second line**

To print two stars, we multiply `"*"` by `2`:

```python
print("*" * 2)
```

---

# ✅ **Final Solution**

```python
print("*")
print("*" * 2)
```

This program prints:

```
*
**
```
