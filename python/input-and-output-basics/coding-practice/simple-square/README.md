# 📝 **Step-by-Step Explanation**

## **Step 1: Understand the problem**

We need to print a square made of stars (`*`).
The square should look like this:

```
**
**
```

That means:

- First line → 2 stars
- Second line → 2 stars

So we simply need to print two lines, each containing `"**"`.

---

## **Step 2: Write the code**

To print stars in Python, we can multiply the `*` symbol by 2:

```python
print("*" * 2)
```

This prints:

```
**
```

We repeat the same for the second line:

```python
print("*" * 2)
```

---

# ✅ **Final Solution**

```python
print("*" * 2)
print("*" * 2)
```

This program prints a simple 2×2 square using stars.
